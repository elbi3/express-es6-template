Boilerplate Express.js server with some es6 updates. 

Got tired of rewriting this for every single proof-of-concept project that used express-generator.

Note: If cloning this project, go to `bin/www` and change the project name on line 11 to the correct project name (currently it is set to "express-es6-template").

Note 2: Useful install from ["Moving to Express4" migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-4.html#example-migration) : `npm install serve-favicon morgan method-override express-session body-parser multer errorhandler express@latest pug@latest --save`
